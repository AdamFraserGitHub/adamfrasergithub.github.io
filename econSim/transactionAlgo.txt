initially the plan was to have one random transaction pairing for the day and if it was unsuccessfull "go home" for the day
this wouldn't work for multiple reasons not least of which is that it makes no sense and isn't how people work

now random sellers and buyers will be paired, if a transaction was made it's effects take place and the two entities are removed
from the current round of the simulation. if a transaction was not made the buyer is paired up with a different RANDOM seller that 
has not yet been involved in a transaction
