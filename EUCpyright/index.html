        <b><h1>How will this actually affect me?</h1></b>
        <br>
        <b><h2>Article 13 (kills innovation and memes)</h2></b>

        <p><b style="color:white;">Article 13 basically requires companies to make sure that everything that is uploaded to their site is 100% original</b>. what's wrong with that? The technology required to monitor all material being uploaded to a website is extremely difficult and expensive to engineer and operate. this means that only companies like YouTube and Facebook could afford these new laws essentially killing smaller sites and making new sites almost impossible. As if that weren't enough article 13 completely ignores fair use where you can republish copyrighted material so long as you alter it or provide commentary this means that unless there was explicit permission from the original creator things like <b style="color:white;">remixes, movie clips, live streams and even memes could be made effectively illegal.</b><p>

        <b><h2>Article 11 (kills news and sharing)</h2></b>
        <p>Article 11 (the "link tax") was designed so that "news" companies are paid whenever a link is shared from their site, seems like a good idea right? wrong! for starters the law was written by senile eurocrats who don't understand the first thing about the internet thats why the law is so loosely defined that anything from a Facebook post to an investigative article from reuters could potentially be charged to you. <br> <b style="color:white;">want to share a screenshot of an album cover? fee! want to share a news article? fee! want to share a video of a goal? fee!</b></p>
    
        <br>
        <b><h2>wait i thought we were leaving the EU</h2></b>
        <p>yes we are! but these laws won't affect just EU citizens they will affect the entire internet. companies will not opperate two very different versions of a website or app for different countries it would simply be too expensive. this is exactly what happened with the EU's recent online privacy law, people from Shanghai to San-Francisco were affected by the law. additionally since the UK is still in the process of leaving the EU we can't know what kind of deal we will get and so we may have to obey EU laws finland style anyway.</p>
